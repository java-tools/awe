## Introduction

We look forward to create a product which helps software companies in overcoming the problems they are usually faced to:

* Large development team implies **huge training costs** on new technologies and losing focus on business logic.
* **Need of migration** instead of rebuild old applications from scratch.
* Techonology evolution is accelerating and we need **stable process of development**.

## What is AWE?

AWE is an engine which allows developers to define structures which are translated 
into web screens, **without knowing anything about web development** and getting isolated 
from web technology advances impact, but getting benefit of them.

AWE also provides some tools to easy the web development, as:

* Configure your **authentication** method.
* Make **queries** to SQL and NO-SQL databases.
* Send/receive messages over **JMS queues**.
* Launch **services** to interact with your business logic:
  * Direct **Java** method calls.
  * Connect to **microservice** architectures.
  * Simplified **REST** API calls.
* Automatic **email** composing made easy.
* Retrieve screen data as a **report**.
* **Multiple language** support.
* Customize your application with our color **themes**.
* Add our **pregenerated screens** ready to be used.

## Modules

There are some modules developed around AWE which offers some useful functionalities for AWE applications development and management.
Actual modules are:
* **Developer**: Development tools to ease AWE applications development. Here you can find some functionalities such as dynamic locale generation or CRUD window generation. 
* **Scheduler**: Process scheduler. Allows to run scheduled tasks when their requirements are fullfilled: launch on a certain date, when a file has changed or manually.  
* **Tools**: Set of DevOps tools which can be integrated as application options. It contains a SQL query launcher or a file manager.
* **Rest**: Module which generates a REST API automatically for the AWE-generated application. It contains automatic documentation generated by Swagger.
