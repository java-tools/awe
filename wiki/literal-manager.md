# **Literal Manager**

## What is it

The *Literal Manager* is a tool that helps managing existing literals of an application. All the available actions and modifications are stored both in memory and in the multiple XML-s. This way, it is not necessary to restart the *Tomcat* server everytime a change is made, it is enough to refresh the page to display all the changes.

## What can it do

1. Search for existing literals.
2. Create new literals.
3. Modify existing literals.
4. Translate literals automatically to other languages.
5. Delete literals.

### Searching existing literals

![search-lite](images/search-lite.png)

Searches can be done by code or literal. The default search language is the same as the application default language, but it can be configured to search by any other *installed* language. By clicking on the search button next to the textfield, all the results appear in the left grid. In order to manage these literals, it is enough to click on any of them to display the details and translations of the chosen word.

### Deleting literals

This process is completed by selecting the literal that has to be deleted and clicking the delete button.

### Creating literals

New literals can be created by clicking on the *New* button. A modal view will appear with two inputs, the first one for the literal *code* and the second one to the literal contend in the default or chosen language. The tool generates the translatios for the other existing languages automatically.

### Modifying literals

In order to modify existing literals, a literal must be chosen from the list displayed on the left grid. The content of the literal appears in the Text / Markdown editor. Markdown is a markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. This makes possible to add styles in a simple way.

### Translating literals
