## Introduction

One of the main features of the scheduler, is the powerful tool that allows to create any kind of schedule in a simple way. 

For this purpose, and with the simplicity in mind, the schedule creation has been separated into three main schedule options:

### 1. Repetitive schedules ###

Schedules that are launched every `X` time. We can choose the time that has to pass between launches, and the time unit that is going to be used.

See more about repetitive schedules [here](#repetitive-schedules).

### 2. One time Schedules ###

This kind of schedule will launch a task just once.

See more about one time schedules [here](#one-time-schedules).

### 3. Custom schedules ###

The custom schedule allows to create every possible configuration that the Quartz Scheduler can work with. The custom schedule configuration screen uses dependencies in order to help the user with the correct creation of the schedule by enabling / disabling criterions when needed.

See more about custom schedules [here](#custom-schedules).

## Repetitive schedules ##

The repetitive schedule, as its name suggest, allows to create schedules that are launched every `X` time, where `X` is the time between one launch to the next one.


Depending on the time unit we choose, some other options will appear into the configuration screen to help the user to create a more advance schedule.

But first, the next fields are common for all the possible options.

| Option       | Definition    | Use | Disables |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------- |:-------------: | 
| Calendar | A holiday calendar to use for the current task, the task won't be launched in the dates contained by the calendar | Optional | `Execution date` |
| From ^1 | The start date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | None |
| To ^2 | The end date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | None |
| Repeat each | The time that has to pass between executions | **Required** | None |


***

^1: If the `From` criterion is empty, the task will be launched at the moment it's created.

^2: If the `To` criterion is empty, the task will be launched indefinitely until its configuration changes, or the task is removed.
