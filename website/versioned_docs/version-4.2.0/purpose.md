## Introduction

We look forward to create a product for helping software companies to overcome the problems they may face:

* Large development teams imply **huge training costs** on new technologies and losing focus on business logic.
* **Necessity of migrate** instead of rebuild old applications from scratch.
* Technology evolution is speeding up and we need **stable process of development**.

## What is AWE?

AWE is an engine which allows developers to define structures which are translated 
into web screens, **without knowing anything about web development** and getting isolated 
from web technology progress, but getting benefit of it.

AWE also provides some tools to make the web development easier, such as:

* Hability to use various **authentication** methods.
* Perform **queries** to SQL and NO-SQL databases.
* Send/receive messages over **JMS queues**.
* Launch **services** to interact with your business logic:
  * Direct **Java** method calls.
  * Connect to **microservice** architectures.
  * Simplified **REST** API calls.
* Automatic **email** composing made easy.
* Retrieve screen data as a **report**.
* **Multiple language** support.
* Customize your application with our color **themes**.
* Add our **pregenerated screens** ready to be used.

## Modules

There are several modules developed around AWE which offer some useful functions for app development and management:
* **Developer**: Development tools to ease AWE applications development. This module provide several functions such as dynamic locale generation or CRUD window generation. 
* **Scheduler**: Process scheduler. Allows to run scheduled tasks whenever a condition is fulfilled: launch on a certain date, when a file has changed or manually.
* **Tools**: Set of DevOps tools which can be integrated as application options. It provides an SQL query launcher and a file manager.
* **Rest**: Module which generates a REST API automatically for the AWE-generated application. Automatic documentation provided by Swagger.
