In this tutorial we will learn how to create screens with AWE and to layout the components needed for the screen as we wish.

## Generating a screen

Once the development has begun, the easiest way to design a new screen is **copying a similar one and changing what we are interested in**. For an initial development, we can copy already developed AWE screens.

Another option is to create an **empty XML file** and add the tags as we need them.

The folder where we will include the screen will be **screen**, inside of our project's folder:

```bash
application # root directory of your application
├── src
│   └── main
|       └── java
|       └── resources
|       |   └── application.[App ID] # xml directory
|       |       ├── global
|       |       ├── locale
|       |       ├── menu
|       |       ├── profile
|       |       └── screen
|       ├── ...
├── pom.xml
├── ...
```

### Screen file creation

The structure of an initial window is as follows:

```xml
<screen xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://aweframework.gitlab.io/awe/docs/schemas/screen.xsd" template="window" label="SCREEN_TITLE_USR" help="HELP_SCREEN_TITLE_USR" keep-criteria="true">
  <tag source="buttons">
    ...
  </tag>
  <tag source="center">
    ...
  </tag>
  <tag source="hidden">
    ...
  </tag>
</screen>
```

In this example you can find several items:

* `screen` tag: Is the tag that defines a screen. It has several mandatory attributes like `xmlns:xsi` and `xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation` that define the validation schema to be used with the screen, along with other attributes that will be defined later.

* `tag` tags with `source` attribute: Each AWE window uses a template (defined in attribute `template`) and every template has som entrypoints defined (`source`). Everything defined inside a `tag` tag with a `source` attribute defined is included in the corresponding entrypoint of the template.

Other attributes of `screen` tag are:

* `template` **(mandatory)**: is the template que are going to use. The template decides the initial format that we are going to work with. At this moment there are only two templates: **full** and **window** (check [Screen areas](#screen-areas)).
* `label` **(mandatory)** is a [locale](api/i18n-internationalization.md) that dictates the title of the screen (it will appear in the upper part of the browser).
* `help` **(optional)** is a [locale](api/i18n-internationalization.md) that will hold an explanation of what the screen does (afterwards, this information will be available for visiting in screen's help context).

There are many more attributes available for the tags (check links of [`screen`](api/screen.md#screen-attributes) and [`tag`](api/tags.md#tag-attributes))

### Locales

Inside of **locale** folder of our AWE project, we will find a file with format `Locale-[LANGUAGE].xml` with all text translated for each language that should be used within the application. Each text has an identifier, that will be called **locale** from now on.

<img alt="Folders" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/folders.png')} />


Locale files have the following format:

```xml
<locales xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://aweframework.gitlab.io/awe/docs/schemas/locale.xsd">
  ...
  <locale name="LOCALE_IDENTIFIER" value="Locale text"/>
  ...
</locales>
```

Every time we add a new locale, is necessary to insert it manually **alphabetically ordered by identifier**, and in every language defined in the application.

To improve the addition of new locales, a [**developer module**](awe-105.md) has been developed, we will talk about it later and it helps a lot with this task.

### Adding file to menu

Inside of **menu** folder, there are two files: `public.xml` and `private.xml`.

<img alt="Folders" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/folders.png')} />

`public.xml` file contains the list of options that can be accessed without authentication within the application. `private.xml` file contains those options that do need authentication.

File format is as follows:

```xml
<menu screen="home_horizontal" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://aweframework.gitlab.io/awe/docs/schemas/menu.xsd" context="screen/private/home" default-action="screen">
  <option name="information" screen="info" invisible="true" />
  <option name="tools" label="MENU_TOOLS" icon="wrench">
    <option name="sites" label="MENU_TOOLS_SITES" screen="Sit" icon="sitemap">
      <option name="new_site" screen="SitNew" invisible="true"/>
      <option name="update_site" screen="SitUpd" invisible="true"/>
      <option name="view_site" screen="SitViw" invisible="true"/>
    </option>
    <option name="modules" label="MENU_TOOLS_MODULES" screen="Mod" icon="puzzle-piece">
      <option name="new_module" screen="ModNew" invisible="true" />
      <option name="update_module" screen="ModUpd" invisible="true" />
      <option name="view_module" screen="ModViw" invisible="true" />
    </option>
  </option>
</menu>
```
Options included inside other options are considered to be in a **lower level**, so options at top level can be found in the **main toolbar** and their children are hosted in **submenus**.

To add a new option, we find the spot where we want it to be shown and we add a line with the name of the option (`name` should be unique), filename that holds the screen without the `.xml` suffix (`screen`). Also, we can add a locale (`label`) and an [icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) (`icon`).

## Screen areas
Given the **template** selected, several areas (**sources**) can be used in a screen:

* **full** template only has 2 sources: **center** and **hidden**. It does not have a defined structure. Source **center** defines the complete sctructure of the template. Everything included in source **hidden** will not be visible.

<img alt="Full template" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/plantilla-full.png')} />


* **window** template has 4 sources: **center**, **buttons**, **modal** and **hidden**. Source **buttons** is useful to include the main buttons of the screen (those that affect the whole content). Source **center** will hold window's content. Source **modal** is used for defining [modal dialogs](#dialogs) in the screen. Finally, source inside **hidden** we will define those components that should not be shown.

<img alt="Window template" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/plantilla-window.png')} />

## Adding HTML tags

`tag` tag can be translated into any HTML tag simply by specifying it in `type` attribute:

```xml
<tag type="div" style="my-class" id="test"></tag>
```

This will result into:

```xml
<div class="my-class" id="test"></div>
```

> For more info about **tags** click [here :link:](/api/tags.md).

## Adding a `window` component

One of most basic components in AWE is the `window`:

<img alt="Window component" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/window.png')} />

It is useful for defining different logic areas of the screen and group components. Also, it has a button area interesting for **executing actions** over other windows (or even the same).

It also has a button for *maximizing/restoring* it, allowing the user to access to more data in a single sight.

AWE window's **structure** is as follows:

```xml
<window label="SCREEN_TEXT_CRITERIA" icon="filter">
  <tag type="div" style="panel-body">...</tag>
  <tag type="div" style="panel-footer">
    <tag type="div" style="pull-right">...</tag>
  </tag>
</window>
```
Inside of `tag` with style **panel-body** we would include the componets (criteria) that we would like to show. `tag` with style **panel-footer** allows to create an area where buttons could be added (to align to the right, inside of `tag` with style **pull-right**).

If we want to include a grid or a chart, is not necessary to include the **tags** with **panel-body** and **panel-footer**, we can add those components directly:

```xml
<window label="SCREEN_TEXT_DATA" icon="list" maximize="true">
  <grid id="miGrid" ...>
    ...
  </grid>
</window>
```

> For more info about **windows**, go check [here](/api/window.md).

## Expandible and static

AWE is able to fill all the space offered by a screen by expanding certain components. For this, is necessary to **denote in father's tag** how we want the children to be expanded and in each child.

This way, if we have a screen with two windows:

```xml
<tag source="center" type="div" expandible="vertical">
	<window label="SCREEN_TEXT_CRITERIA">
       ...
    </window>
    <window label="SCREEN_TEXT_DATA" style="expand">
      ...
    </window>
</tag>
```

In the father

```xml
<tag source="center" type="div" expandible="vertical">
```

we say that we want the children to expand vertically and in one child

```xml
<window label="SCREEN_TEXT_DATA" style="expand">
```

we say we want it to be expanded. It would be something like this:

<img alt="Layout vertical several expands" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/layout-vertical.png')} />


> **Note:** The children without **expand** style will keep their size, given the components they hold.

If there is more than one child expanding, the available space will be divided among all children expanding in the following way:
<img alt="Vertical layout several expands" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/layout-vertical-2-expands.png')}/>
Layouts can also be combined to form different structures:
<img alt="Combined layout" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/layout-combinado.png')}/>

> For more info about **layouts** check [here :link:](/api/layout.md).

## Buttons

Buttons are one of the basic components in AWE. Button's definition es very simple muy powerful at the same time. Inside each button we can invoke one or several actions that affect the behaviour of the defined screen.

<img alt="Buttons" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/botones.png')}/>


To include a button, we will use the `button` tag:

```xml
<button label="BUTTON_NEW" icon="plus" id="ButNew">
  <button-action type="screen" target="newWindow" />
</button>
```

In this example, when you click the button the application will navigate to the window whose option has as name **newWindow**.

```xml
<button button-type="submit" label="BUTTON_SEARCH" icon="search" id="ButSch" help="HELP_SEARCH_BUTTON">
  <button-action type="validate" />
  <button-action type="filter" target="idGrid" />
</button>
```

This other button will validate the criteria defined first, and if there is no error, it will launch an action of type `filter` over the component **idGrid**, what will force a reload of the component's data.

> For more info about **buttons** click [here :link:](/api/button.md).

## Tabs

Inside of a screen we may want to have the information distributed accross tabs. In AWE there is the `tab` component (not to be mistaken with `tag`) and `tabcontainers` inside `tabs` to hold the content.

```xml
<tab id="tabId" initial-load="[initial-load]" target-action="[enumerated-query-identifier]">
  <tabcontainer id="idTabcontainer1">
  ...
  </tabcontainer>
  ...
  <tabcontainer id="idTabcontainerN">
  ...
  </tabcontainer>
</tab>
```

Withing the `tab` component we say where would we like to take the data from, wether from an [enumerated](awe-104.md#enumerated) (`initial-load="enum"`) or from a [query](awe-104.md#queries) (`initial-load="query"`). In both cases, the field `label` corresponds to the **text** shown in the tab and the field `value` to the **identifier** of the `tabcontainer` associated to the tab.

<img alt="Tabs" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/tab.png')}/>


> **Note:** Tabs work as [**criteria**](awe-103.md), they are a list of values with a selected value.
> For more info on **tabs** click [here :link:](/api/tab-and-tabcontainer.md).

## Wizard

Wizards in AWE work in a **similar way to tabs**. `wizard` component contains one or more components of type `wizard-pane`, that will hold the content that belongs to each step of the wizard.

```xml
<wizard id="idWizard" initial-load="[initial-load]" target-action="[enumerated-query-identifier]" label="LOCALE">
  <wizard-panel id="idPanel1">
     ...
  </wizard-panel>
  <wizard-panel id="idPanel2">
     ...
  </wizard-panel>
</wizard>
```

In the `wizard` component we specify where we want to obtain the data from, wether an [enumerated](awe-104.md#enumerated) (`initial-load="enum"`) or from a [query](awe-104.md#queries) (`initial-load="query"`). In both cases, the field `label` corresponds to the **text** shown as the step description and the field `value` to the **identifier** of the `wizard-panel` associated to the step.

The attribute `label` will hold a locale with the text shown as a title in every step, followed by the step number.

<img alt="Wizard" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/wizard.png')}/>

Also, the `wizard` defines a series of [actions](/api/actions.md#component-actions) that can be invoked from a button to move forward or backwards.

```xml
<button label="BUTTON_PREVIOUS" icon="chevron-circle-left" id="BkStep1">
  <button-action type="prev-step" target="idWizard"/>
</button>
<button label="BUTTON_NEXT" icon="chevron-circle-right" id="FwStep3" style="btn-primary">
  <button-action type="validate" target="idPanel2"/>
  <button-action type="next-step" target="idWizard"/>
</button>
```

> **Note:** Wizards, as tabs, work as a [**criteria**](awe-103.md), they are a list of values with a selected one.
> For more info on **wizards**, check [here :link:](/api/wizard-and-wizard-panel.md).

## Dialogs

A dialog in AWE is a window shown over the existing content, useful for **completing additional information**, **consulting extra data** or to **perform a complementary action** to the existing in the screen.

To define a dialog, we use the `dialog` tag:

```xml
<dialog id="idDialog" modal="true" style="normal" label="TITLE_DIALOG" icon="print" help="HELP_DIALOG">
  <tag type="div" style="modal-body row">
    ...
  </tag>
  <tag type="div" style="modal-footer">
    ...
  </tag>
</dialog>
```

`dialog`s, like `window`s, have specific styles to define its content: **modal-body** will hold the content of the dialog and **modal-footer** its buttons.

<img alt="Dialog" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/dialog.png')}/>

The right way to add a `dialog` to a screen with the **window** template is using the `source` **modal**.

To open a dialog, it is necessary to invoke a `dialog` action as shown:

```xml
<button id="openDialog" label="BUTTON_OPEN_DIALOG" icon="floppy-o">
   <button-action type="dialog" target="idDialog" />
</button>
```

And inside of the dialod, we can include buttons as follows to accept and cancel:

```xml
<button label="BUTTON_CANCEL" icon="close" id="ButDiaCan">
  <button-action type="close" target="idDialog" />
</button>
<button label="BUTTON_ACCEPT" icon="check" id="ButDiaVal" button-type="submit">
  <button-action type="server" server-action="maintain" target-action="storeData" />
  <button-action type="close" target="idDialog" />
</button>
```

> For further information about **dialogs** click [here :link:](/api/dialog.md).

## Including parts of other screens

In some ocasions, we will have the need to reuse a group of components in several screens (like a dialog, for instance). To achieve this, AWE provides a tag called `include` that allows to include all the content of a screen inside of another:

```xml
<include target-screen="screenName" target-source="sourceName" />
```

In this case, we would include the content of **sourceName** from the screen **screenName.xml** inside of our screen.

:::caution
It is important to know that when using an `include`, **there should be no identifier of the content included** equivalent to any identifier of our current screen, because it may crash.
