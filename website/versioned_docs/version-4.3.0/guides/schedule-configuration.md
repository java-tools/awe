title: Schedule Tasks Configuration

The scheduler is a powerful tool which allows to create any kind of schedule in a simple way. 

For this purpose, and with the simplicity in mind, the schedule creation has been designed to have three main options: 

## Repetitive schedules

Schedules that are launched every `X` time. We can choose the time between launches.

The repetitive schedule, as its name suggests, allows to create schedules to be launched every `X` time, where `X` is the time between one launches.

Depending on the time unit, other options will be available to help users to create advanced schedules.

But first, the next fields are common for all the possible options:

| Option       | Definition    | Use | Disables |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------- |:-------------: | 
| Calendar | A holiday calendar to use for the current task, the task won't be launched in the dates contained by the calendar | Optional | `Execution date` |
| From ^1 | The start date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | None |
| To ^2 | The end date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | None |
| Repeat each | The time between executions | **Required** | None |

***

^1: If the `From` criterion is empty, the task will be launched first at the moment it's created.

^2: If the `To` criterion is empty, the task will be launched indefinitely until its configuration changes, or the task is removed.

> **Note:** If one of the optional values inside the configuration is left empty, the default `All` value will be applied.


## One time Schedules

This kind of schedule will launch a task just once.

This schedule type launches a task only once, by creating a cron pattern with an specific date and time.

The available fields to create this kind of task are:

| Option       | Definition    | Use | Disables |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------- |:-------------: | 
| Execution date | The launch date. | **Required** | None |
| Execution time | The launch time. | **Required** | None |

> **Note:** At least one of the two criterions need to be filled.

## Custom schedules

The custom schedule allows to create every possible configuration the Quartz Scheduler can work with. The custom schedule configuration screen uses dependencies in order to help the user with the correct creation of the schedule by enabling / disabling criterions when needed.

The custom schedule offers all the available fields that can be customized to create the cron pattern.


| Option       | Definition    | Use | Disables |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------- |:-------------: | 
| Calendar | A holiday calendar to use for the current task, the task won't be launched in the dates contained by the calendar | Optional | `Execution date` |
| From ^1 | The start date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | `Execution date`,`Execution time` |
| To ^2 | The end date / time for the current task schedule | Optional | `Execution date`,`Execution time` |
| Years | The years that the schedule will be launch. | Optional | `Execution date` |
| Months | To specify which months we want to launch the task | Optional | `Execution date` |
| Days | To specify which days of the month we want to launch the task | Optional | `Execution date`,`Days of the week` |
| Days of the week | To specify which days of the week we want to launch the task | Optional | `Execution date`,`Days` |
| Hours | The hour the task will be launched | Optional | `Execution time`|
| Minutes | The minutes the task will be launched | Optional | `Execution time` |
