Developer module offers a series of tools designed to facilitate developer's tasks.

## User manual

In order to use the developer module, it is necessary to:

1. Include the following dependency in project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.almis.awe</groupId>
  <artifactId>awe-developer-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Add awe-developer module to `config.properties` file
```bash title="config/library.properties"
# Utilities list
modules.list=app,developer,tools,awe
module.awe=awe
module.tools=awe-tools
module.developer=awe-developer
```


3. Add the following options in `public.xml` or `private.xml` files:

```xml title="public.xml or private.xml"
<option name="developer" label="MENU_DEVELOPER" icon="paint-brush">
  <option name="path-manager"  label="MENU_PATH" screen="path-manager" icon="italic"/>
  <option name="local-manager" label="MENU_LANGUAGES" screen="local-manager" icon="language"/>
</option>
```

## Selecting XML file path

Firstly, is necessary to define the path where application's XML files are located, so developer tools can found and modify them:

<img alt="Path selection" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/path.png')} />

It is important that the path we add matches the **root of our XML files**. All application's folders with the XML files will be in such place:

<img alt="Folders" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/folders.png')} />

## Locale manager

The locale manager is a tool that allow to **add**, **modify** and **delete** an application's locales:

All actions performed affect the memory as well as the actual XML files. This way, **it is not necessary to reload the application server** everytime a change is done, it is just enough to reload the webpage.

Also, the locale manager works side by side with a translation API that offers an initial approximation to the translated text to the different languages used in the application when a new locale is added. It also allows to perform translations in real time.

The locale manager has some criteria that allow to **select the language** that we are going to work with and to do a **search of already existing locales**:

### New locale

To add a new locale, we have to click the *New* button that can be found in the lower part of the **locale list**:

<img alt="Locale list" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/lit-list.png')} />

A dialog will appear where we have to introduce the **locale code** (unique identifier) and the text in the language that we **have selected in language criteria**. 

<img alt="Locale addition" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/new-lit.png')} />

When adding a new locale, it will be created in **all the languages defined in the application** automatically. It is advisable to check the automatic translation to see if it is correct.

### Modify locale

If we select a locale in the list of locales, **all the translations of that locale will appear as well**:

<img alt="List of locales in different languages" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/translation-list.png')} />

If we select a language, we can modify the value of that locale in that language:

<img alt="Modifying the value" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/text-trans.png')} />

If we select the **Markdown** tab, we can edit the text using markdown instead of just plain text:

<img alt="Markdown value modification" src={require('@docusaurus/useBaseUrl').default('img/training/markdown-trans.png')} />

If we want to do an automatic translation, we have to select the original language and the desired one in the selector criteria and click the **Translate** button; the text will be automatically translated.

To save all modifications, we need to click the **Update** button.

### Delete locale

If we select a locale from the list and click the **Delete** button, it will be removed from the list in all available languages.
