AWE allows developers to configure the application session in two ways: Using the default `HttpSession` (Basic session) 
deployed by the application server or using Spring Session instead.

## Basic session

AWE, by default, uses a basic application server `HttpSession` object. So no action is required to configure this option. This option is useful when you deploy your application on a clustered environment and the balancer server uses the `JSESSIONID` cookie generated by the application server.

## Spring session

Spring session allows the application to be deployed using a shared session server storage, such as REDIS, MONGO, HAZELCAST or
even JDBC connections. To activate the usage of spring session in your application simply add the following depencency
to your `pom.xml` file:  

```xml
<!-- Spring session -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-session</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The configuration of spring session is defined on `session.properties`. These properties are defined on [properties configuration page](properties#session-properties).
