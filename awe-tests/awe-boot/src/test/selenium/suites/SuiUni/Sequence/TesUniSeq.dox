 * \section SecNewSeq New sequence
 *  Test for adding a new sequence to the application.
 *  It creates a new 'sequence test' sequence. This are the parameters given to the new sequence:
 *    - CrtKeyNam : 'testKey'
 *    - CrtKeyVal : '0'
 *    - Active    : 'Yes' (1)
 *
 * \section SecSeqViw View sequence
 *  Test for verifying that the added sequence is correct.
 *  This process search the name of the new sequence in the correspondent criterion
 *  of sequence management window, it selects it and goes to 'View' window to visualise it.
 *
 * \section SecChangeSeq Update sequence
 *  Test for modifying a defined sequence.
 *  This process search the name of the new sequence in the correspondent criterion
 *  of sequence management window, it selects it and goes to 'Update' window to modify it.
 *  Afterwards, it changes the sequence 'testKey' to which it is assigned setting value to '1' 
 *  and active parameter to 'No' and confirmes the modifications.
 *
 * \section SecViwChangeSeq View updated sequence
 *  Test for verifying that the modifications made on the sequence are correct.
 *  This process search the name of the updated sequence in the correspondent criterion
 *  of sequence management window, it selects it and goes to 'View' window to to visualise it.
 *
 * \section SecSeqDel Delete sequence
 *  Test for verifying the delete of one sequence.
 *  This process search the name of the 'testKey' sequence in the correspondent criterion
 *  of sequence management window, it selects it and pushes 'Delete' button to delete it.
 *
 * \section SecViwDelSeq Verify Delete sequence
 *  Test for verifying that the delete of sequence 'testKey' was correct.
